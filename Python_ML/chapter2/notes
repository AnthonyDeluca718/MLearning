Goals:
• Building an intuition for machine learning algorithms
• Using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib to read in, process, and visualize data
• Implementing linear classification algorithms in Python

Single Neuron:
- Input x
- Weight vector w
- Net-input / Activity: z = w*x
- Activation: f(z)
- Usually we take x0 = 1, and define a constant term w0 (equivalent to setting activation to f'(z') = f(z + w0) )

Perceptron:
- f(z) = Heaviside function
- Classifies a set into two classes: {+1, -1}
- Learning Rule:
